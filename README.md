# Seb Dybowski's dotfiles
Set of configs and scripts I use on Linux & MacOS.

# Usage
This comman will clone files into your **home/user directory**.
`cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/sebdybowski/dotfiles.git ./`

# Scripts
If you only want to use my scripts without the dotfiles, find them in (this repository)[https://github.com/sebdybowski/scripts].
